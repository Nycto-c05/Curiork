in Go, strings are in utf8 encoding, hence can take more than 8 bits-ASCII

The len() repr the number of bytes in a string
The string asciiStr := "Hello" is 5 bytes because each character in the string is an ASCII character, and each ASCII character is represented as 1 byte (8 bits) in memory.


since utf supports char outside of utf8, hence can take up more bytes

utf can take upto 4 bytes

hence len(Î“) = 2
